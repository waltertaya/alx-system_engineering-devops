# Project Title: Web Stack Debugging #1

## Description

This project involves debugging an issue with Nginx not listening on port 80 in an Ubuntu container. The task includes identifying the problem and creating Bash scripts to automate the fix. Two scripts are provided: one addressing the fix with the minimum number of commands and another, an advanced version, ensuring the fix is concise and follows strict Bash scripting requirements.

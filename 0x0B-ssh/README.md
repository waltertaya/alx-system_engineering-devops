# 0x0B-ssh

## Introduction

* SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure protocol used as the primary means of connecting to Linux servers remotely.
* SSH connection is implemented using a client-server model.
* This means that for an SSH connection to be established, the remote machine must be running a piece of software called an SSH daemon.
* This software listens for connections on a specific network port, authenticates connection requests, and spawns the appropriate environment if the user provides the correct credentials.
* The user’s computer must have an SSH client. This is a piece of software that knows how to communicate using the SSH protocol and can be given information about the remote host to connect to, the username to use, and the credentials that should be passed to authenticate. The client can also specify certain details about the connection type they would like to establish.

## How SSH Authenticate Users

* Clients generally authenticate either using passwords (less secure and not recommended) or SSH keys, which are very secure.
* Password logins are encrypted and are easy to understand for new users. However, automated bots and malicious users will often repeatedly try to authenticate to accounts that allow password-based logins, which can lead to security compromises. For this reason, we recommend always setting up SSH key-based authentication for most configurations.
* SSH keys are a matching set of cryptographic keys which can be used for authentication. Each set contains a `public` and a `private key`. The `public key` can be shared freely without concern, while the `private key` must be vigilantly guarded and never exposed to anyone.
* To authenticate using `SSH keys`, a user must have an `SSH key pair on their local computer`. On the `remote server`, the `public key` must be copied to a file within the user’s home directory at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This file contains a list of `public keys`, one-per-line, that are authorized to log into this account.
* When a client connects to the host, wishing to use SSH key authentication, it will inform the server of this intent and will tell the server which public key to use. The server then checks its `authorized_keys` file for the public key, generates a random string, and encrypts it using the public key. This encrypted message can only be decrypted with the associated private key. The server will send this encrypted message to the client to test whether they actually have the associated private key.
* Upon receipt of this message, the client will decrypt it using the private key and combine the random string that is revealed with a previously negotiated session ID. It then generates an MD5 hash of this value and transmits it back to the server. The server already had the original message and the session ID, so it can compare an MD5 hash generated by those values and determine that the client must have the private key.

## Generating and Working with SHH Keys

* Generating a new SSH public and private key pair on your local computer is the first step towards authenticating with a remote server without a password.
* A number of cryptographic algorithms can be used to generate SSH keys, including `RSA`, `DSA`, and `ECDSA`. `RSA keys` are generally `preferred` and are the `default key type`.
* To generate an RSA key pair on your local computer, type:

```Bash
ssh-keygen
```

* Inputs for `ssh-keygen`:

```Bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

* This prompt allows you to choose the location to store your `RSA private key`. Press `ENTER` to leave this as the default, which will store them in the `.ssh` hidden directory in your `user’s home directory`. Leaving the default location selected will allow your `SSH client to find the keys automatically`.

```Bash
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

* The next prompt allows you to enter a passphrase of an arbitrary length to secure your private key. By default, you will have to enter any passphrase you set here every time you use the private key, as an additional security measure. Feel free to press `ENTER` to leave this blank if you do not want a passphrase. Keep in mind though that this will allow anyone who gains control of your private key to login to your servers.
* If you choose to enter a passphrase, nothing will be displayed as you type. This is a security precaution.

```Output
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
8c:e9:7c:fa:bf:c4:e5:9c:c9:b8:60:1f:fe:1c:d3:8a root@here
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|       +         |
|      o S   .    |
|     o   . * +   |
|      o + = O .  |
|       + = = +   |
|      ....Eo+    |
+-----------------+
```

* This procedure has generated an RSA SSH key pair, located in the .ssh hidden directory within your user’s home directory. These files are:
  1. ~/.ssh/id_rsa: The private key. DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE!
  2. ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: The associated public key. This can be shared freely without consequence.

## Generate an SSH Key Pair with a Larager Number Of Bits

* SSH Keys are 2048 bits by default. This is generally considered to be good enough for security, but you can specify a greater number of bits for a more hardened key.
* To do this, include the `-b` argument with the number of bits you would like. Most servers support keys with a length of at least 4096 bits. Longer keys may not be accepted for DDOS protection purposes:

```Bash
ssh-keygen -b 4096
```

* If you had previously created a different key, you will be asked if you wish to overwrite your previous key:

```Bash
Overwrite (y/n)?
```

* If you choose “yes”, your previous key will be overwritten and you will no longer be able to log in to servers using that key. Because of this, be sure to overwrite keys with caution.

## Removing or Changing the Passphrase on a Private Key

* If you have generated a passphrase for your private key and wish to change or remove it, you can do so easily.

`Note: To change or remove the passphrase, you must know the original passphrase. If you have lost the passphrase to the key, there is no recourse and you will have to generate a new key pair.`

* To change or remove the passphrase, simply type:

```Bash
ssh-keygen -p
```

`Enter file in which the key is (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):`

* You can type the location of the key you wish to modify or press ENTER to accept the default value:

`Enter old passphrase:`

* Enter the old passphrase that you wish to change. You will then be prompted for a new passphrase:

`Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:`

* Here, enter your new passphrase or press ENTER to remove the passphrase.

## Displaying the SSH Key Fingerprint

* Each SSH key pair share a single cryptographic “fingerprint” which can be used to uniquely identify the keys. This can be useful in a variety of situations.
* To find out the fingerprint of an SSH key, type:

```Bash
ssh-keygen -l
```

`Enter file in which the key is (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):`

* You can press ENTER if that is the correct location of the key, else enter the revised location. You will be given a string which contains the bit-length of the key, the fingerprint, and account and host it was created for, and the algorithm used:

## Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server with SSH-Copy-ID

* To copy your public key to a server, allowing you to authenticate without a password, a number of approaches can be taken.
* If you currently have password-based SSH access configured to your server, and you have the ssh-copy-id utility installed, this is a simple process. The ssh-copy-id tool is included in many Linux distributions’ OpenSSH packages, so it very likely may be installed by default.
* If you have this option, you can easily transfer your public key by typing:

```Bash
ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
```

* This will prompt you for the user account’s password on the remote system:

`The authenticity of host '111.111.11.111 (111.111.11.111)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
demo@111.111.11.111's password:`

* After typing in the password, the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key will be appended to the end of the user account’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

# 0x19. Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Postmortem

## Overview

In the world of DevOps, we often face challenges that test our skills and patience. This postmortem dives into an unexpected outage we experienced, unraveling the mystery behind the downtime and sharing insights on how we resolved it.

## Issue Summary

- **Duration**: 3 hours, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**: Web service outage affecting 30% of users
- **Root Cause**: Database connection pool exhaustion

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM**: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating high request latency.
- **10:15 AM**: Engaged in initial investigation, suspecting a potential issue with the load balancer.
- **10:45 AM**: Realized the database connection pool was nearing its limit, causing delays in query execution.
- **11:30 AM**: Escalated the incident to the database team for further diagnosis.
- **12:15 PM**: Implemented a temporary fix by increasing the connection pool size.
- **1:00 PM**: Service restored to normal operation after deploying the fix.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: The database connection pool was exhausted due to a sudden spike in user requests, causing delays and timeouts.
- **Resolution**: Increased the database connection pool size and optimized query execution to handle the load efficiently.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements**:
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect connection pool exhaustion earlier.
  - Optimize database queries and implement caching strategies.
  
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement automated alerts for monitoring database connection pools.
  - Review and optimize database queries for better performance.
  - Conduct a load test to simulate high traffic scenarios and validate the fixes.
